# React Commands Quick Guide

This guide provides a quick overview and essential commands for managing and running React projects.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.
Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


## Run in dev

```
 npm run dev
```

## Building for Production

To create a production build of your app, which optimizes the application for performance:

- **Build the app**: `npm run build`

This command builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

## Other Useful Commands

- **Test the app**: `npm test`
  Runs the test watcher in an interactive mode.

- **Eject configuration**: `npm run eject`
  **Note**: This is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!

This command will remove the single build dependency from your project and copy all the configuration files and transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them.
